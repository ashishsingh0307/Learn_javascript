    TYPES OF MEMORY

        1.) STACK (PRIMITIVE)
        
            Stack is used for primitive datatypes which stacks values over values or variables over variable. In stack when we assign variable_1 value to other variable_2. for instance:-
            1) first we take variable_1 and value and then we take variable_2 which is equal to variable_1 then we are not changing the value of variable one even if we change value of variable_2. 

            variable_1 = 15
            variable_2 = variable_1
            variable_2 = 20

            in stack memory above variable_2 is not going to change the value of variable_1 as in 2nd line variable_2 is just copying the value of variable_1

        2.) HEAP (NON-PRIMITIVE)
