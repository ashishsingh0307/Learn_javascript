// JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXT

/*

    -> Javascript divides your program or code in 2 Phases

        => Whenever JS executes your code it makes a Global Execution Context(GEC). (whenever this keyword is used in a global scope it will give you GEC).
            - When we use browser and type console.log(this); it will give use window object.
            - When run in node environment it gives us blank object.
            etc.

            There are 3 Types of Execution Context
                1) Global Execution Context.
                2) Function/Functional Execution Context.
                3) Eval Execution Context.
